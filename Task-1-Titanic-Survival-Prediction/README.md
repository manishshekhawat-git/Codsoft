 Titanic Survival Prediction

 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning techniques.  
It is a beginner-friendly data science project that uses historical passenger data.

 Dataset
The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers such as:
- Passenger class
- Gender
- Age
- Fare
- Survival status

Dataset source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

 Approach
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Handle missing values
3. Convert categorical data into numerical form
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Train a Logistic Regression model
6. Evaluate model accuracy

 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

 Model Used
- Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)

 Result
The model predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on input features and achieves good accuracy for a beginner-level project.

 Conclusion
This project demonstrates the basic workflow of a machine learning classification problem and is suitable for beginners in data science.
